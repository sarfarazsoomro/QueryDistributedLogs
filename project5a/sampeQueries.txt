joinNW> >ackJoin joinedNW> >joinedNWAck ;o,ni|joinNW> >ackJoin joinedNW> >joinedNWAck ;o,ni

change the other part to no, i so it's more flexible

joinNW> >ackJoin joinedNW> >joinedNWAck ;o,ni|joinNW> >ackJoin joinedNW> >joinedNWAck ;no,i

what we can conclude from this queries result is that
1) the second query element exposes a potential error in application
2) For eg. A node shouldn't receive ackJoin Msg before it sends out a joinNW msg
3) Another potential error we can see from this diag is that a node should receive ackJoin from the node to which it sent joinNW msg

limiting the number of search results per query element? so it's easier to view

running the below query can help us pin point many such errors as above but it may return large number of results, so we would 

like to limit the number of matches to n(first n matches)

limit per execUnit
>MsgMsg ;l1
Otherwise the above would be undrawable
global limit
>MsgMsg ;l1 $l10

limit on the entire system:
joinNW> >ackJoin joinedNW> >joinedNWAck ;no,i 
above returns a lot of results but we can limit the number of matches on global scale as well
joinNW> >ackJoin joinedNW> >joinedNWAck ;no,i $l10

here we see that a node receive ackJoin first and sends out joinNW later, which is erratic, we would like to see if there are 
other nodes acting the same way so design the following query

we enforce ordering, but let there be interleaving of other msgs

>ackJoin joinNW> ;o,i $l10
using the above query we also find more such erroneous cases where ackJoin is received prior to joinNW

more on limits, diff b/w limit on exec unit and global limit
============================================================
a query element may be satisfied more than once in an exec. unit, this may result in large number of matches per exec. unit,
while we may want to examine matches accross different exec units, that's where both these options work together to make
it easy to see limited number of matches but also from variety of nodes, the following example illustrates this

>MsgMsg MsgDelivered> ;o,i,l1 $l10

an example with 3 query elements
================================
joinNW> >ackJoin joinedNW> >joinedNWAck ;o,ni| MsgMsg> | >MsgDelivered $l10
